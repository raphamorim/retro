## Why?

Retro is a project that seeks to aggressively rethink Vim in order to:

- A lot of popular plugins ported to Retro
- Minimalist and Simplest visual ever
- Chromium-based GUI
- Enable advanced external UIs without modifications to the core
- Full Extensible'n Hackable Editor (allow to change interfaces brutally)
	- Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture

## Objective

The goal of the project is to create a extensible/hackable experience for VIM users, built on open web standards.

Nowadays our focus will be specifically about speed, stability, experience and productivity.
